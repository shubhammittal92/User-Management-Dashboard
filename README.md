# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


### 'Future Improvements'
If given more time, I would consider implementing the following improvements:

Backend Integration: Integrate a backend API for managing users and connecting the frontend with a database.
Advanced User Management: Add role-based access control to manage user permissions.
Testing: Implement more comprehensive unit and integration tests using libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.
User Authentication: Add login and authentication features for securing the dashboard.
